## Description

This repo will demonstrate how to use [vudrm](http://vudrm.vualto.com/) with [THEOplayer](https://www.theoplayer.com/).
If you have any questions please contact support@vualto.com

This repo is currently targeted at THEOplayer version 2.51.1

## Instructions

### Install dependencies

1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Install the [grunt-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-cli): `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Vualto/vuplay-theoplayer.git`
4. Navigate to the project's root folder: `cd vuplay-theoplayer`
5. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Build and run the dev environment

1. Open the repository in your favourite javascript editor.
2. In file `src/vuplay.js` replace `<your-stream-url>` with your stream url. This must can be a [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) or [HLS](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) stream.
3. In file `src/vuplay.js` replace `<your-vudrm-token>` with a vudrm token from [https://admin.drm.technology](https://admin.drm.technology)
4. Uncomment the appropriate code in the file `src/vuplay.js`. The code you uncomment will depend on the stream technology you want to use.
5. Run `grunt build` in the project's root. This will create a `dist` folder that contains all the files need to run this demo.
6. Run `grunt serve`, this will run the build task from the previous step and start a development node.js server. This server is not suitable for production.
7. Load a supported browser and go to `https://theoplayer.local.vuplay.co.uk:14703`
    - You will need to add the host `theoplayer.local.vuplay.co.uk` to your local machine's hosts file in order for this to work. Or use a domain that is compatible with your THEOplayer license.

NB: In order to allow DRM encrypted playback in chrome (https://goo.gl/EEhZqT), SSL has been enabled for the demo. You will get a warning about an invalid cert `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` but this can safely be ignored.

### Browser support

The browser must support [encrypted media extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-encrypted-media-20160705/).
Currently this includes the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Edge, and Safari.
For a complete breakdown of supported media extensions please contact support@vualto.com
